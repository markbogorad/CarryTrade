# Volatility-Based Carry Trade Strategy

## Overview

This project enhances the traditional carry trade strategy by implementing a dynamic volatility-based indicator. Using advanced GARCH models, the project optimizes returns and minimizes risk during volatile market conditions.

## Methodology

GARCH Model Estimation: The TARCH model was chosen for its effectiveness in modeling volatility asymmetry in G10 currencies.
Indicator Implementation: A dual-layer volatility indicator adjusts portfolio exposure based on forecasted and realized volatility.
Portfolio Reconstruction: Portfolios were reconstructed under the indicator, showing improved cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios.

## Results

The volatility-based indicator significantly enhances the carry trade strategy by improving risk-adjusted returns and stabilizing portfolio growth.
